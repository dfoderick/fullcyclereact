# Full Cycle React
Front end React web site for the Full Cycle Mining Controller 
(https://github.com/dfoderick/fullcycle)

Install dependencies using the following commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/dfoderick/fullcyclereact.git
cd fullcyclereact
npm install
```
It can be run with yarn or npm. npm seemed to be a little faster
for production.  
```
sudo npm run dev
```

If you can use yarn then do so with the following command...
```
yarn dev
```
!Important! The web page will be blank or show an error if the back end Full Cycle Mining Controller is not running.
